# Mare Nostrum
Singleplayer strategy game where you compete against several AI’s for control over the mediterranean by the means of war or marital inheritance.

Your goal is to conquer all regions through war or marital inheritance. You will lose the game if all your regions are conquered or if you die without an hier. To get an heir, you have to marry another character and hope for a pregnancy. At death, a character's regions get distributed among his/her children. 

To get more gold or soldiers from a region you can upgrade your holdings, this is done through pressing the different icons in the region window. You can also upgrade the region’s defenses.

The player can make alliances to gain strength in wars. If a war reaches +100 warscore you can enforce demands and force the enemy to surrender. If a war reaches -100 warscore, the enemy will force you to surrender. You can also try for a white peace if you want to end the war. 

Mare Nostrum was developed in C++ using the library SFML during 10 weeks as a degree project at Futuregames, a higher vocational education for game development in Stockholm, Sweden.
